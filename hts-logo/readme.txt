the photoshop files must be saved as black on white

I loaded a selection, deleted the white so the black would show through, save for the web, undo the deletion, and load the next selection and repeat.

When loading into inkscape I set the default scale because it was giving me different results from the jpg and the png (despite them being the exact same resolution)

I exported the svg and blender I got multiple curves, one per layer.  Seems like the boolean subtract is giving me issues so I did a remesh of each curve before I subtracted it from anything
