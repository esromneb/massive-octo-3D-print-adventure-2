# Purpose
Flite test stopped selling the power pack that goes with the frame that this was originally designed for.

## Solution
The Flite Test Sidewinder edition of the Gremlin cost more but has a carbon fiber frame and ships with 2-4S support which is great.

# Design
I am expanding the previous design ()


# Frame Files
I don't know if they exist or where they are.
